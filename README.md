# AI & ML Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains my hands-on learning, projects, and case studies across:
- Data Foundations
- Machine Learning (Supervised & Unsupervised)
- Generative AI
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Agentic AI (LangChain, LangGraph)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- LangChain, LangGraph
- OpenAI APIs
- Vector Databases

## Highlights
- End-to-end ML case studies
- RAG systems with document ingestion & retrieval
- Agent-based workflows with tool calling

This repository reflects my continuous upskilling and practical implementation of AI systems.
